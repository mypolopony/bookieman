## Aim
I was chatting with one of my very good friends, a post-doctoral student, who was seeking a book deal. He suggested that it might be possible to identify trends in certain topics and thus predict, in some sense, what will sell, and thus what a publisher would be willing to support.

This is a very lofty goal and this solution certainly does not address all of the conditions that demand attention, but it is an interesting way to define trends in literature.
